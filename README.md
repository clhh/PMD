PHP Module Definition

The PHP Module Definition (PMD) API specifies a mechanism for defining modules such that the module and its dependencies can be loaded when required. By this way,php coding can be easily migration, developing, debugging, and reading.

The PMD api is similar to the AMD apis,a few differences are their running environment and grammer.
